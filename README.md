> **Abstract:** Successful and efficient teamwork requires knowledge of the individual team members' expertise. Such knowledge is typically acquired in social interaction and forms the basis for socially intelligent, partner-adapted behavior. This study aims to implement this ability in teams of multiple humanoid robots. A humanoid robot, Nao, interacted with three Pepper robots to perform a sequential audio-visual pattern recall task that required integrating multimodal information. Nao outsourced its decisions (i.e., action selections) to its robot partners to perform the task cost-efficiently in a gated reinforcement learning framework. During the interaction, Nao learned its partners' specific expertise which allowed Nao to turn for guidance to the partner who has the expertise corresponding to the current task state. To do this, we endow the learner robot with two cognitive modules: multimodal auto-associative memory to determine the cost of perceptual processing (i.e., cognitive load) by processing audi-visual input and internal reward module to generate rewards based on cognitive load incurred on the learner robot during the experiment. In this setting, the learner robot aims to minimize the cognitive load by adapting partnersâ€™ specific knowledge through determining the correct partner for a given task state.  Overall, the results indicate that the learner robot successfully adapts to the specifics of robot partners to perform the interactive task.
